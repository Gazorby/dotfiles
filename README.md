## Dotfiles manager

Use `dotfile.py` to link dotfiles under `config/` :

```bash
usage: dotfile.py [-h] [-a PATH [PATH ...]] [-u PATH [PATH ...]] [-d DIRECTORY]

Dotfile utility

optional arguments:
  -h, --help            show this help message and exit
  -a PATH [PATH ...], --add PATH [PATH ...]
                        save a path in dotfile config. PATH can be a full path or a directory. If the latter is used, all files will be recursively added
  -u PATH [PATH ...], --update PATH [PATH ...]
                        recursively update all links from files under PATH. Root permissions will be asked if needed
  -d DIRECTORY, --dotfile DIRECTORY
                        specify dotfile directory
```

## Make targets

`make` is used to install tools and configurations, but not all targets are meant to be used by hand.

Use `make help` to display infos on most useful targets

### Fish config :
  ```bash
  make fish
  ```
  Will try to automatically install all dependencies listed in `dependencies.txt` with your system's packet manager

  If you miss some of the dependencies listed in `dependencies.txt` in your distribution repositories, then it will install rust and compile them from source.
https://github.com/oh-my-fish/plugin-python
  ```bash
  make git
  ```

  This call [tree](#link-config-tree) target before and creates the following structure in your home directory :

  ```console
  ~/
    |
    .gitconfig
    |
    git/
      |
      .git-remotes
      |
      template/
      |
      perso/
        |
        .gitconfig    # to complete with your perso identity
      pro/
        |
        .gitconfig    # to complete with your pro identity
  ```

  This suppose you have the two private keys named like this :

  ```console
  ~/.ssh/
    |
    id_rsa
    id_rsa_pro
    ...
  ```

  The template directory is used by the `gtt` function to init a git repository with the directory tree inside `template` folder.

  I like to separate pro and personal projects by using two private keys. the `.gitconfig` files take care of using the right ssh private key when working on a pro or personal project

  #### .gitconfig
  1) Fill `.gitconfig` files

     Make sure to fill `~/git/perso/.gitconfig` and `~/git/pro/.gitconfig` with your perso / pro identities. I also use auto signing with gpg keys (again, pro and perso), it can be disabled in `~/.gitconfig`

     ```bash
      [user]
        name =
        email =
        signingKey = <GPG key>

      [core]
        autocrlf = input
     ```

1) Fill `.git-remotes` file

    See [fish-git-check-id](https://link)


### Pacman and aria2
  ```bash
  make pacman-aria2
  ```
  Makes pacman using [aria2](https://github.com/aria2/aria2) to download packages

### fstrim-timer
  ```bash
  make fstrim-timer
  ```
  Uses `fstrim-timer` systemd service enable periodic trim on ssd storage

### nvidia
  ```bash
  make nvidia
  ```
  Enables `ForceFullComposiitonPipeline` at boot to eliminate tearing when using nvidia graphic cards

## Custom configuration

Summary of what files inside `config/` do

### ssh

  Uses a fast cipher algo, set alive interval and make all sessions using the same connection

### Journald

  Uses a custom journald config that reduce journal maximum size limit and used memory.

### 20-intel

  Uses common options to improve perf on intel graphics IGPUs

### 99-sysctl

  Reduces swapiness and apply network tweaks

### vlcrc

  Applies compression, an equalizer emphasizing low and high mids, volume normalization plus highest-quality sample rate conversion. (Config from [this gist](https://gist.github.com/ageis/c79ada44c8208f688298bb8437c1d69e))

### After login script

  Symlinks `after-login.sh` in `/etc/profile.d/` to run commands right after login
