# Make all sessions to the same host share a single connection using the three following options :

ControlMaster auto

# Possible values are either :
# - no to close the connection immediately after the last client disconnects,
# - a time in seconds,
# - yes to wait forever, the connection will never be closed automatically.
ControlPersist yes
# ~/.ssh/sockets can be any directory not writable by other users
ControlPath ~/.ssh/sockets/socket-%C

# Use a faster cipher: on modern CPUs with AESNI instructions
Ciphers aes128-gcm@openssh.com,aes256-gcm@openssh.com,chacha20-poly1305@openssh.com,aes256-ctr,aes192-ctr,aes128-ctr

# Keep ssh connectio nalive by sending a keep-alive signal to the server if no data has been received for some time
# ServerAliveInterval Controls the interval between the requests for response sent from the client to the server
ServerAliveInterval 120
